I can't believe I made it out there alive... What's this?
It seems that defeating the monster the day before made me stronger.
I should probably go visit Sergeant Gerad to understand what's happening here.

I don't care if you're sorry, Player's name. We only have 2 more days until this town will be invaded. You have to do something to keep the town safe.
I would suggest exploring the town and seeing what you can do to help out.

You’re in [insert town name]. If there’s a bright center to the universe, you are the furthest away from it. We’re a small band of people. We live simple lives.
We don’t get many outsiders anymore, not since the Grand Path which connects all districts on the continent was finished.
I wonder how you ended up here… Captain [insert name here] can be found on the castle walls. [He/she] is overseeing our anti-invasion strategy.
If there’s any way to strengthen our defenses, the captain would know.
Amelia is the barkeeper at the tavern, been so for as long as I can remember. Word travels around town quickly and she’s at the epicenter of information exchange where people tend to be talkative.
The hunting board is where you can find monsters that lurk outside the castle walls. Defeating them will suffice as your training. I do not have time to train you but you can ask me any questions on how to defeat them.

We have suspicion to believe that the [insert name here] is planning to invade us. 
Normally, we would only be fighting a couple monsters a month that manage to come out of the forest, but recently the number of monsters that have made it to the walls has increased dramatically. 
We sent scouts to investigate a couple weeks ago but they haven’t come back since. I fear the worst, which is why we must be prepared. We’re hopelessly outnumbered and unless you miraculously find a way to fortify our defenses, our small defenses don’t stand a chance.

Are you stupid? Stop stuttering. We only have 2 more days until this town will be invaded. If you don’t do anything, you, me, and everyone else will be dead. You’re wasting my time, please leave.

Are you lying straight to my face?! Get out! I have no time for soldiers who don’t know anything about respect
