### Physics-based simulation

#### Gravitational acceleration 
Simulate gravity so the ball can free fall, roll, slide and rebound.

#### Rolling
Simulate a ball's motion on a surface with minimum friction.

#### Elastic collision
Simulate elastic collision so the ball will bounce on the ice surface.
